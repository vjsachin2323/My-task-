HLD â€“ Security Controls (SCP, Guardrails, KMS, SSL, Encryption)

1. Purpose

To enforce organization-wide security and compliance across AWS accounts using Service Control Policies (SCPs), preventive guardrails, encryption standards with KMS, and secure communication via SSL/TLS.

2. Audience
	â€¢	Security Architects
	â€¢	DevOps / Cloud Engineers
	â€¢	Compliance Team

3. Introduction

This HLD defines the design and implementation strategy for:
	â€¢	SCPs & Guardrails â†’ Preventive policies at OU/account level.
	â€¢	KMS â†’ Centralized key management for encryption at rest.
	â€¢	SSL/TLS â†’ Encryption in transit using ACM certificates.
	â€¢	Encryption Enforcement â†’ Mandatory across S3, EBS, RDS, Redshift, etc.

4. Architecture and Design
	â€¢	SCPs & Guardrails
	â€¢	Deny actions outside approved regions.
	â€¢	Enforce s3:PutObject with x-amz-server-side-encryption.
	â€¢	Block disabling of CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty.
	â€¢	KMS
	â€¢	Customer-managed keys for S3, RDS, Redshift, EBS, Secrets Manager.
	â€¢	Key rotation enabled, policies managed via Terraform/IaC.
	â€¢	SSL/TLS
	â€¢	ACM-issued certificates for all endpoints (ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront).
	â€¢	Enforce TLS 1.2 or above.
	â€¢	Encryption
	â€¢	At-rest: S3, EBS, RDS, Redshift, DynamoDB â†’ all use KMS CMKs.
	â€¢	In-transit: ALB/ELB HTTPS listeners, RDS SSL connections, Redshift SSL.

(Add diagram: SCPs at Org â†’ KMS/SSL applied across accounts â†’ enforced guardrails)

5. List of Components & Services
	â€¢	AWS Organizations (SCPs)
	â€¢	Control Tower Guardrails
	â€¢	AWS KMS
	â€¢	AWS ACM (SSL)
	â€¢	CloudTrail, Config (to validate compliance)

6. Screenshots
	â€¢	Example SCP JSON in console
	â€¢	KMS CMK policy screen
	â€¢	ACM certificate details
	â€¢	Encrypted S3 bucket property

7. Observability (Backup & Restore)
	â€¢	CloudTrail logs for SCP policy changes.
	â€¢	Backup of SCP definitions in GitHub/Azure DevOps repo.
	â€¢	KMS key rotation + recovery supported by AWS.
	â€¢	ACM auto-renewal for certificates.

8. Common Services
	â€¢	Integrated with GuardDuty and Security Hub for continuous compliance.
	â€¢	Linked to centralized Audit Account for monitoring.
