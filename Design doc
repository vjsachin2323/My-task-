2. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the security design for implementing encryption across our AWS environment. This design ensures protection of data at rest, in transit, and during key management while meeting compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

⸻

3. Scope

This design covers:
	•	AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption key lifecycle management.
	•	SSL/TLS for securing data in transit across all public and private endpoints.
	•	Encryption at rest for data stored in S3, EBS, RDS, and Redshift.
	•	Protection of secrets and credentials using AWS Secrets Manager.

⸻

4. Architecture Overview

Diagram

(Insert the diagram we created earlier – showing Client → ALB/CloudFront → Application → Database/Storage, with KMS controlling encryption at rest and TLS in transit.)

⸻

5. Design Principles
	•	Defense in Depth → Multiple layers of encryption (in transit, at rest, keys).
	•	Least Privilege → Minimal IAM access to keys and secrets.
	•	Automation First → Use Terraform/CLI for consistent and auditable deployments.
	•	Compliance Aligned → Meets industry standards (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR).

6. Best Practices & Implementation

6.1 AWS KMS (Key Management)
	•	Use Customer Managed Keys (CMKs) with automatic rotation (12 months).
	•	Apply least privilege key policies for apps and roles.
	•	CloudTrail logging enabled for all KMS API actions.



Implementation Snippet (Terraform)
resource "aws_kms_key" "app_key" {
  description         = "CMK for App Encryption"
  enable_key_rotation = true
}
6.2 SSL/TLS (Data in Transit)
	•	Enforce TLS 1.2 or 1.3 only, disable SSL/TLS 1.0/1.1.
	•	Use AWS ACM for provisioning and renewing certificates.
	•	Redirect all HTTP traffic → HTTPS.
	•	Encrypt internal service communication with TLS.

Implementation Snippet (Terraform)
resource "aws_lb_listener" "https" {
  port            = 443
  protocol        = "HTTPS"
  ssl_policy      = "ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01"
  certificate_arn = aws_acm_certificate.cert.arn
}

6.3 Encryption at Rest
	•	Enable KMS encryption by default for S3, EBS, RDS, and Redshift.
	•	Store credentials in Secrets Manager, encrypted with KMS.
	•	Apply application-level encryption for highly sensitive PII/financial data.

Implementation Snippet (Terraform – S3)
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "sse" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.bucket
  rule {
    apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
      sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.app_key.arn

    }
  }
}
7. Validation & Monitoring
	•	S3 Encryption Check
aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket my-secure-bucket

	•	RDS Encryption Check
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier mysecuredb

   . TLS Verification
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -tls1_2

	•	Enable AWS Config Rules (e.g., s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled).
	•	Monitor CloudWatch alarms for failed decrypt attempts.


8. Compliance Mapping
Standard
Requirement
How Addressed
PCI-DSS
Encrypt cardholder data
KMS + S3/RDS encryption
HIPAA
Encrypt PHI in transit & at rest
TLS + KMS encryption
GDPR
Protect personal data
Secrets Manager + app-level encryption


9. Risks & Mitigations


Risk
Impact
Mitigation

10. Conclusion

By implementing KMS, SSL/TLS, and encryption best practices, this design ensures that all data stored or transmitted in AWS remains secure, compliant, and resilient against unauthorized access.
