HLD – AWS CloudWatch & AWS Config

1. Purpose

To establish a comprehensive monitoring and compliance framework using Amazon CloudWatch for observability (metrics, logs, alarms) and AWS Config for continuous compliance (resource configuration tracking and audit).

2. Audience
	•	Cloud/DevOps Engineers
	•	Security & Compliance Teams
	•	Application Owners

3. Introduction
	•	Amazon CloudWatch provides visibility into application and infrastructure health, enabling alerting, automation, and cost/performance optimization.
	•	AWS Config continuously records and evaluates the configuration of AWS resources to ensure compliance with organizational policies and industry standards.

⸻

4. Architecture & Design
	•	CloudWatch
	•	Metrics: Collects performance & health metrics (EC2, RDS, Lambda, Redshift, etc.).
	•	Logs: Applications and AWS services push logs to CloudWatch Logs.
	•	Alarms: Real-time thresholds trigger alerts (e.g., high CPU, failed API calls).
	•	Dashboards: Custom dashboards for monitoring KPIs.
	•	Events: Integrates with EventBridge for automation (SNS → Slack/Email, Lambda remediation).
	•	AWS Config
	•	Records resource configuration changes (S3 buckets, IAM, Security Groups, KMS, etc.).
	•	Evaluates compliance using managed & custom Config rules.
	•	Delivers compliance snapshots to S3, findings to Security Hub.
	•	Supports remediation via SSM documents or Lambda automation.
	•	Integrated with CloudWatch Alarms & EventBridge for proactive responses.

5. List of Components & Services
	•	CloudWatch Metrics – CPU, memory, network, DB queries.
	•	CloudWatch Logs – Application/system logs.
	•	CloudWatch Alarms – Event-driven alerts.
	•	CloudWatch Dashboards – Visual health monitoring.
	•	CloudWatch Events/EventBridge – Remediation triggers.
	•	AWS Config Recorder – Tracks configuration changes.
	•	AWS Config Rules – Compliance validation.
	•	AWS Config Aggregator – Multi-account compliance view.
	•	S3 + KMS – Secure storage of Config snapshots/logs.
	•	Security Hub / GuardDuty – Centralized security findings.

6. Screenshots (to capture)
	•	CloudWatch dashboard with metrics.
	•	CloudWatch alarm creation screen.
	•	AWS Config compliance dashboard.
	•	Example Config rule (e.g., S3 encryption enabled).

⸻

7. Observability (Backup & Restore)
	•	CloudWatch Logs: Export to S3 (KMS encrypted), lifecycle → Glacier.
	•	CloudWatch Dashboards: Export/import as JSON templates.
	•	AWS Config: Snapshots delivered to central S3 bucket (encrypted).
	•	Restore:
	•	Re-import dashboards into CloudWatch.
	•	Replay Config snapshots from S3 to audit past resource states.

⸻

8. Common Services
	•	CloudTrail – Logs CloudWatch & Config API activity.
	•	KMS – Encrypts Config snapshots and logs.
	•	EventBridge – Responds to Config non-compliance with remediation.
	•	Security Hub – Aggregates compliance results from Config.
	•	SNS / Lambda – Notifications or automated remediation.
